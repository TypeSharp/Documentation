# Hello, World!

Now that you have TypeSharp downloaded, and installed, let's make the infamous "hello world" program in TypeSharp!

## Setup

TypeSharp by default has a utility to create a directory for your project, start by opening a terminal and entering:

```shell
ts init "hello_world"
```

You should now see a directory with similar structure to this:

## Running and Creating a TypeSharp program

After you initialize your TypeSharp project directory, you will see a file in the `src` directory of your project, in this directory you will see a `mod.ts` file, which is the heart of your project. All TypeSharp source files may include a `.ts`, `.t#`, `.typesharp`, or `.tn` file extension.

When you open the autogenerated  `mod.ts` you should see code to a program that looks like the following:

```typescript
println("Hello, world!");
```

In typesharp, there are multiple ways to run/execute your program, however here we'll be using TypeSharp's compiler to build actual binaries.

Now that we have our project initialized, we can test/run it by:

1. Building our binary, using `ts compile`

   ```shell
   ts compile .
   ```

2. Executing the binary built in the newly created directory called `bin`, which includes a binary to be shared, in this case it's a `.exe` file.
