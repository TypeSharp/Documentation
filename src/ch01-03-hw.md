# Hello World

Now that you have TypeSharp downloaded, and installed, let's make the infamous "hello world" program in TypeSharp!

## Setup

Typesharp by default has a [CLI]() utility to manage packages and projects. You can start or initialize a project by opening a terminal and running the following:

```shell
$ ts init "hello_world"
```

After executing the `init` command you should now see a the following in your project directory:

In your `mod.ts` file you can insert the following:

```typesharp
println("Hello World.")
```

> **Notice:** It is important to note, that Typesharp does have a `main-fn` flag for compiling, which will require you to change the code from above to the following if that flag is present:
>
> ```typesharp
> fn main() {
> 	println("Hello World.");
> }
> ```
