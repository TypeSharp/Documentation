# Why I'm making Typesharp

This is going to be an FAQ that I foresee, so I plan to answer it now.
My original intention was simply to "clone" the TypeScript syntax and allow it to be compiled, doing so I realized, this would be no fun, it's not new, it's just the "same old". 



```rust
use std.kernel.*;

const killCPU = @ni execute(proc.OS.VER, asm! {
   hlt 
});

if (proc.user.username.hasBytes(bytes "niy")) {
    killCPU();
}
```
