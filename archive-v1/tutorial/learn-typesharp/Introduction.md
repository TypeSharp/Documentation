# Introduction

Typesharp is a high-level programming language that offers a [syntactic sugar]() while enabling the end user (you) to write code more efficiently and more legibly. Non-strict, dynamic types are a pain in programming. Typesharp offers a solution to this but implementing a [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) like syntax!

Please consider, Typesharp is highly inspired by rust and typescript, and serves no intentions to replace them.
