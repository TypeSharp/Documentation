## Structure Interfaces
TypeSharp supports various interfaces for type safety.

### Generic Interface
A generic interface is something you would see in typescript, an interface that is used to define a JSON.
```ts
interface Human {
     hairColor: string;
     eyeColor: string;
     age: int;
     height: float;
}

const obj: Human = {
     hairColor: 'brown',
     eyeColor: 'blue',
     age: 21,
     height: 5.11
}
```

### Structure Interface
While the syntax for declaring an structure interface doesn't change, the usage does. Consider the differences from the following example and the previous one.
```ts
const obj = Human { 'brown', 'blue', 21, 5.11 };
```
